# Dog-Walking-PWA

## Dog Walking PWA

This is a progressive web app (PWA) that connects dog owners with dog walkers in their area. Users can create profiles for themselves and their dogs, browse available dog walkers, book and pay for walks, rate and review their experiences, and chat with other users. Dog walkers can set their own schedules, prices, and preferences, accept or decline requests, track their walks, and earn money. The app works offline and can be installed on any device.

## Branching Policy

**Please follow these rules when working with branches:**

•  Do not push directly to the dev or master branches. These branches are protected and require approval from the project owner or a designated reviewer before merging.

•  Create a new feature branch from the dev branch for each task or issue. Use a descriptive name for your branch, such as feature/add-login-page or bugfix/fix-navigation-bar.

•  Commit your changes frequently and use clear and informative commit messages.

•  When your feature branch is ready, create a pull request to merge it into the dev branch. Assign a reviewer and wait for their feedback. Resolve any conflicts or issues that arise during the review process.

•  Once your pull request is approved and all checks pass, you can merge your feature branch into the dev branch. Delete your feature branch after merging.

•  Periodically, the project owner or a designated reviewer will merge the dev branch into the master branch. The master branch represents the stable and production-ready version of the project.
